Narration, Commercial, and Other Genres of Voice Over Talent - Right Here.
![](https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/bde61df0-f2f5-4107-931d-b400ee688534.jpg)

Welcome to my website! I'm Matthew Kovacs.

I'm a Voice Over artist, and I'm SUPER passionate about my
work! In my experience, producing high-quality audio work is the result of superior, reputable training, quality recording equipment, and innate talent. I have received professional evaluation and private instruction from a fantastic voice over
studio based in NYC. They are called Edge Studio, and they are awesome. 

I generally find myself under the BROAD umbrella of Narration work. This includes, but is not limited to taking on projects in the areas of:  
**Corporate Industrial**: Training Tutorials, New-Hire videos, Promotional videos, Presentational videos, and more...  
**eLearning and Educational**: Computer and Web Based Trainings, Do-It-Yourself videos, Software Tutorials, Self-Help videos, and more...  
**Announcements**: Public Transportation, Airports, Entertainment Venues, Train Stations, and more...  
**Non-Profit**: Marketing, Promotional, and Outreach videos...  
And even **Documentaries**, **Self-Guided Tours**, and **Commercial projects**!

Rates fluctuate based on type of work, amount of work, and availability. Please submit your project inquiry, including:

_\*Genre type_

_\*Copy (script)_

_\*Number of words to be read (or range)_

_\*Any specific directions, desired read styles, or descriptions associated with thecopy_

\*_Estimated Reach/Audience Size_

\*_Duration of Use_

_\*Project Turn-Around Time_

_\*Budget range for this project_
