Narration, Commercial, and Other Genres of Voice Over Talent - Right Here.

Welcome to my website! I''m Matthew Kovacs.

I'm a Voice Over artist, and I'm SUPER passionate about my
work! In my experience, producing high-quality audio work is the result of
innate talent combined with superior, reputable training. I have received
private instruction and professional evaluation from a fantastic voice over
studio based in NYC. They are called Edge Studio, and they are awesome. 

I focus mainly on the Narration genre in Voice Over, and I
record my audio with quality equipment and software!
