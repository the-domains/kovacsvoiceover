Narration, Commercial, and Other Genres of Voice Over Talent - Right Here.

# Welcome to my website! I'm Matthew Kovacs.

I'm a Voice Over artist, and I'm SUPER passionate about my
work! In my experience, producing high-quality audio work is the result of superior, reputable training, quality recording equipment, and innate talent. I have received professional evaluation and private instruction from a fantastic voice over
studio based in NYC. They are called Edge Studio, and they are awesome. 

I generally find myself under the BROAD umbrella of Narration work. This includes, but is not limited to taking on projects in the areas of:  
**Corporate Industrial**: Training Tutorials, New-Hire videos, Promotional videos, Presentational videos, and more...  
**eLearning and Educational**: Computer and Web Based Trainings, Do-It-Yourself videos, Software Tutorials, Self-Help videos, and more...  
**Announcements**: Public Transportation, Airports, Entertainment Venues, Train Stations, and more...  
**Non-Profit**: Marketing, Promotional, and Outreach videos...  
And even **Documentaries**, **Self-Guided Tours**, and **Commercial projects**!

# About My Voice

It's critical that a Voice Over artist has their voice evaluated by an objective professional. After all, we perceive ourselves differently than the rest of the world does, so it's best to get an unbiased third party evaluation so you can confidently communicate the nature and qualities of your vocal instrument.

My voice has been described as **_Naturally Dynamic_**, which allows me to easily__add enthusiasm and a variety of colors to my delivery.  
My voice has also been described as: believable, charming, compassionate, cool, deep, dignified, easygoing, educational, expressive, gravely, hip, intelligent, inviting, laid back, luxurious, neighborly, personable, powerful, smooth, trustworthy and warm.

> (I) naturally sound like a buddy, everyman, story teller and teacher.

Some of my strengths are:   
Taking direction well and applying it to my deliveries.  
Not afraid of taking "risks", when appropriate, resulting in the ability to produce a variety of deliveries.   
Having well-trained ears (in addition to a well trained voice), from years of acting, singing, and other performances. Being able to fine tune listening skills increases the ability to effectively self-monitor my deliveries. This translates to a higher-learning curve, which can potentially shorten the amount of time the project takes. 

Rates fluctuate based on type of work, amount of work, and availability. Please submit your project inquiry, including:
