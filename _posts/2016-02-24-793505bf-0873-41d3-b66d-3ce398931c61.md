Narration, Commercial, and Other Genres of Voice Over Talent - Right Here.

Welcome to my website! I'm Matthew Kovacs.

I'm a Voice Over artist, and I'm SUPER passionate about my
work! In my experience, producing high-quality audio work is the result of
innate talent, superior, reputable training, and quality recording equipment. I have received
private instruction and professional evaluation from a fantastic voice over
studio based in NYC. They are called Edge Studio, and they are awesome. 

I generally find myself under the BROAD umbrella of Narration work. This includes, but is not limited to taking on projects in the areas of:  
**Corporate Industrial**: Training Tutorials, New-Hire videos, Promotional videos, Presentational videos, and more...  
**eLearning and Educational**: Computer and Web Based Trainings, Do-It-Yourself videos, Software Tutorials, Self-Help videos, and more...  
**Announcements**: Public Transportation, Airports, Entertainment Venues, Train Stations, and more...  
**Non-Profit**: Marketing, Promotional, and Outreach videos, Voicemail/Telephone services, and more...  
And even **Documentaries**, **Self-Guided Tours**, and **Commercial projects**!
